This is a tentative beginning to (what might be) a capstone project. More specifically I want to create an app for a loan officer for the approval or rejection of loans in which the variables to determine creditworthiness can be altered and tweaked according to a lending institution's priorities. At first commit it asks only for a minimum credit score requirment, and has only three dummy applicants with names and credit scores in an SQL database. The project might grow in the future with more info required from applicants and/or a larger set of dummy data of credit applications, and more options for variables to be chosen by the user of the app to determine creditworthiness.
